/**
 * The files that should be excluded from the caller search
 *
 * When trying to figure out which module requested a particular
 * resource, the file that called e.g. $this->load->view('filename')
 * will be used to determine the module. However, in some cases you
 * might need to exclude certain files in this search. Perhaps you are
 * using a custom view library. In that case, whenever you call the
 * custom method, the library will be considered the caller instead of
 * your controller and so the module cannot be determined. Therefore
 * you will need to add the file to this array.
 *
 * If you have multiple files with the same name, but you only wish
 * to exclude one of them, you can also add a bit of the filepath to
 * distinguish it from the others.
 *
 * NO FILE EXTENSION!
 *
 * Prototype:
 * $config['callers'] = array('libraries/filename');

 * The directories in which your modules are located

 * folder in which to look for modules. You'd usually want to have at
 * least 'modules' in your array which will have codeigniter look for
 * modules in /application/modules. You can add as many directories
 * as you like, though.

 * NO TRAILING SLASHES!
